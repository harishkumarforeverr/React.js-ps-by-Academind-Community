<p>In the previous lecture, we explored <code>useEffect()</code>&nbsp;dependencies.</p><p>You learned, that you should add "everything"&nbsp;you use in the effect function as a dependency - i.e. all state variables and functions you use in there.</p><p>That is correct, but there are a <strong>few exceptions</strong> you should be aware of:</p><ul><li><p>You <strong>DON'T need to add state updating functions</strong> (as we did in the last lecture with <code>setFormIsValid</code>):&nbsp;React guarantees that those functions never change, hence you don't need to add them as dependencies (you could though)</p></li><li><p>You also <strong>DON'T need to add "built-in"&nbsp;APIs or functions</strong> like <code>fetch()</code>, <code>localStorage</code> etc&nbsp;(functions and features built-into the browser and hence available globally): These browser&nbsp;APIs / global functions are not related to the React component render cycle and they also never change</p></li><li><p>You also <strong>DON'T&nbsp;need to add variables or functions</strong> you might've <strong>defined OUTSIDE of your components</strong> (e.g. if you create a new helper function in a separate file):&nbsp;Such functions or variables also are not created inside of a component function and hence changing them won't affect your components (components won't be re-evaluated if such variables or functions change and vice-versa)</p></li></ul><p>So long story short:&nbsp;You must add all "things"&nbsp;you use in your effect function <strong>if those "things"&nbsp;could change because your component (or some parent component)&nbsp;re-rendered.</strong> That's why variables or state defined in component functions, props or functions defined in component functions have to be added as dependencies!</p><p>Here's a made-up dummy example to further clarify the above-mentioned scenarios:</p><pre class="prettyprint linenums">import { useEffect, useState } from 'react';

let myTimer;

const MyComponent =&nbsp;(props)&nbsp;=&gt;&nbsp;{
  const [timerIsActive, setTimerIsActive] = useState(false);

  const { timerDuration } =&nbsp;props;&nbsp;// using destructuring to pull out specific props values

  useEffect(()&nbsp;=&gt;&nbsp;{
    if (!timerIsActive) {
      setTimerIsActive(true);
      myTimer =&nbsp;setTimeout(()&nbsp;=&gt;&nbsp;{
        setTimerIsActive(false);
      }, timerDuration);
    }
  }, [timerIsActive, timerDuration]);
};</pre><p>In this example:</p><ul><li><p><code>timerIsActive</code> is <strong>added as a dependency</strong> because it's component state that may change when the component changes (e.g. because the state was updated)</p></li><li><p><code>timerDuration</code> is <strong>added as a dependency</strong> because it's a prop value of that component - so it may change if a parent component changes that value (causing this MyComponent component to re-render as well)</p></li><li><p><code>setTimerIsActive</code> is <strong>NOT added as a dependency</strong> because it's that <strong>exception</strong>:&nbsp;State updating functions could be added but don't have to be added since React guarantees that the functions themselves never change</p></li><li><p><code>myTimer</code> is <strong>NOT&nbsp;added as a dependency</strong> because it's <strong>not a component-internal variable</strong> (i.e. not some state or a prop value) - it's defined outside of the component and changing it (no matter where)&nbsp;<strong>wouldn't cause the component to be re-evaluated</strong></p></li><li><p><code>setTimeout</code> is <strong>NOT added as a dependency</strong> because it's <strong>a built-in API</strong>&nbsp;(built-into the browser) - it's independent from React and your components, it doesn't change</p></li></ul>
